# Bikesharing

## Overview
### For this anlysis we imported the data into Tableau to dynamically show what we learned. Using Tableau we were able to create and style worksheets, dashboards, and stories. Choosing to use Tableau worksheets was done to display data accurately in a professional way.

## Results
### Analyzing the data we notice most of the rides are within an hour of time.
